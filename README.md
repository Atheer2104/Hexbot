# Hexbot
Hexbot is an simple app using the api from the noopschallenge.com that provides hex colors. using it and display the colors with additional small features

The purpose of this project was to take part in the noopschallenge and I wanted to use swift because I'm relearning it from the begning. I saw this as an good oppurtunity so I could create something myself and that this project would take much time. 

Here are some screenshot and a video that showcase the app
